# AHRS_Validation_Apparatus_CAD
CAD files for a project to help validate an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS). The apparatus holds an IMU and hall-effect rotary encoder to test attiude angles about single axes, separately. This was a spinoff from my PhD research on autonomous surface vehicles at the University of California at Santa Cruz in the Autonomous Systems Laboratory.
